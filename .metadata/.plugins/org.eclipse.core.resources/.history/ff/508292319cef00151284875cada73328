	 * Image Baron is a cruel master of images.

	 * and then gives them out.
	 * 
	 * Basically Image Baron is an abstraction of image loading.
	 * It makes it so we're not loading an image directly from
	 * file errytime we load something. It also makes it so 
	 * you don't have to worry about doing the ugly code to
	 * load an image.
	 * 
	 * !!! WARNING: only **one* image baron can exist at a time.
	 * Image baron is a jealous master. If you have multiple
	 * Image barons, then you're essentially screwing with his 
	 * purpose and it makes him sad.
